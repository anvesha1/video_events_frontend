1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,450
Let's work through another
few scenarios involving

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,860
displacement, velocity, and
time, or distance, rate,

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,050
and time.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,450
So over here we have, Ben is
running at a constant velocity

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,370
of three 3 meters per
second to the east.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,940
And just as a review,
this is a vector quantity.

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,170
They're giving us the
magnitude and the direction.

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,490
If they just said 3
meters per second,

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,550
then that would just be speed.

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,050
So this is the magnitude,
is 3 meters per second.

11
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,480
And it is to the east.

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,630
So they are giving
us the direction.

13
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,620
So this is a vector quantity.

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,090
And that's why it's
velocity instead of speed.

15
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:51,400
How long will it take
him to travel 720 meters.

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,820
So let's just remind
ourselves a few things.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,389
And I'll do it both with
the vector version of it.

18
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,180
And maybe they should
say, how long will it

19
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:03,660
take them to travel
720 meters to the east,

20
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,599
to make sure, to make it clear,
that it is a vector quantity.

21
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:09,890
So that it's displacement,
as opposed to just distance,

22
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,570
but we'll do it both ways.

23
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,250
So one way to think about it, if
we think about just the scalar

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,750
version of it, we said
already that rate or speed

25
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:25,060
is equal to the distance that
you travel over some time.

26
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,420
I might write t there.

27
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,960
But it's really
a change in time.

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,251
So sometimes some people
would write a little triangle,

29
00:01:30,251 --> 00:01:32,340
a delta there, which
means change in time.

30
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,280
But that's implicitly
meant when you just

31
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,950
write over time like that.

32
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,420
So rate or speed is equal
to distance divided by time.

33
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,086
Now, if you know-- they're
giving us in this problem,

34
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:44,210
they're giving us the rate.

35
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,460
If we think about the
scalar part of it,

36
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,480
they're telling us that
that is 3 meters per second.

37
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,759
And they're also
telling us the time.

38
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,550
Or, sorry, they're not
telling us the time.

39
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,340
They are telling
us the distance,

40
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,580
and they want us to
figure out the time.

41
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,075
So they tell us the
distance is 720 meters.

42
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,870
And so we just have to
figure out the time.

43
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,699
we So if we just do the
scalar version of it,

44
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,740
we're not dealing with
velocity and displacement.

45
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,650
We're dealing with the
rate or speed and distance.

46
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,560
So we have 3 meters
per second is

47
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:28,857
equal to 720 meters over
some change in time.

48
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,690
And so we can algebraically
manipulate this.

49
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,850
We can multiply both
sides times time.

50
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,240
Multiply time right over there.

51
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,697
And then we could,
if we all-- well,

52
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:44,280
let's just take it
one step at a time.

53
00:02:44,280 --> 00:03:00,490
So 3 meters per second times
time is equal to 720 meters

54
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,930
because the times on the
right will cancel out

55
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,990
right over there.

56
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,800
And that makes sense,
at least units-wise,

57
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,480
because time is going
to be in seconds,

58
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,620
seconds cancel out the
seconds in the denominator,

59
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,710
so you'll just get meters.

60
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,226
So that just makes sense there.

61
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,600
So if you want to
solve for time,

62
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,210
you can divide both sides
by 3 meters per second.

63
00:03:24,324 --> 00:03:25,990
And then the left
side, they cancel out.

64
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,320
On the right hand
side, this is going

65
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:37,170
to be equal to 720
divided by 3 times meters.

66
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,670
That's meters in the numerator.

67
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,870
And you had meters per
second in the denominator.

68
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,520
If you bring it out
to the numerator,

69
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,750
you take the inverse of this.

70
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,840
So that's meters-- let me do
the meters that was on top,

71
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,840
let me do that in green.

72
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,715
Let me color code it.

73
00:03:48,715 --> 00:03:50,570
So 720 meters.

74
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,520
And now you're dividing
by meters per second.

75
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,020
That's the same
thing as multiplying

76
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,649
by the inverse, times
seconds per meters.

77
00:03:57,649 --> 00:03:59,190
And so what you're
going to get here,

78
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,648
the meters are
going to cancel out,

79
00:04:00,648 --> 00:04:04,770
and you'll get 720
divided by 3 seconds.

80
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,890
So what is that?

81
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,650
720 divided by 3.

82
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,650
72 divided by 3 is 24.

83
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,230
So this is going to be 240.

84
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,010
This part right over
here is going to be 240.

85
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,339
And it's going to
be 240 seconds.

86
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,230
That's the only unit
we're left with,

87
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,670
and on the left hand side,
we just had the time.

88
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,700
So the time is 240 seconds.

89
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,214
Sometimes you'll see it.

90
00:04:30,214 --> 00:04:32,130
And just to show you,
in some physics classes,

91
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,090
they'll show you
all these formulas.

92
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,964
But one thing I really
want you to understand

93
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:37,380
as we go through this
journey together,

94
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,050
is that all of those
formulas are really

95
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,500
just algebraic
manipulations of each other.

96
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,700
So you really shouldn't
memorize any of them.

97
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,325
You should always
say, hey, that's just

98
00:04:45,325 --> 00:04:48,080
manipulating one of those other
formulas that I got before.

99
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,500
And even these formulas are,
hopefully, reasonably common

100
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,000
sense.

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,166
And so you can start from
very common sense things--

102
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,100
rate is distance
divided by time--

103
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,660
and then just
manipulate it to get

104
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,911
other hopefully
common sense things.

105
00:04:58,911 --> 00:05:00,160
So we could have done it here.

106
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,470
So we could have multiplied
both sides by time

107
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,400
before we even put
in the variables,

108
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,540
and you would have gotten--
So if you multiplied

109
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:12,100
both sides by time here,
you would have got,

110
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,400
on the right hand side, distance
is equal to time times rate,

111
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,370
or rate times time.

112
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,250
And this is one
of-- you'll often

113
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,350
see this as kind of
the formula for rate,

114
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,740
or the formula for motion.

115
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,030
So if we flip it around, you get
distance is equal to rate times

116
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,780
time.

117
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,652
So these are all
saying the same things.

118
00:05:30,652 --> 00:05:32,360
And then if you wanted
to solve for time,

119
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,290
you could divide
both sides by rate,

120
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:39,020
and you get distance divided
by rate is equal to time.

121
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,720
And that's exactly what we got.

122
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,240
Distance divided by
rate was equal to time.

123
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,150
So if your distance
is 720 meters,

124
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,800
your rate is 3
meters per second,

125
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,090
720 meters divided by
3 meters per second

126
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,350
will also give you a
time of 240 seconds.

127
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,240
If we wanted to do
the exact same thing,

128
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,705
but the vector version
of it, just the notation

129
00:05:57,705 --> 00:05:59,080
will look a little
bit different.

130
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,050
And we want to keep track
of the actual direction.

131
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:08,000
So we could say we
know that velocity--

132
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,870
and it is a vector quantity,
so I put a little arrow on top.

133
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,320
Velocity is the same
thing as displacement.

134
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,890
Let me pick a nice color
for displacement-- blue.

135
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,230
As displacement-- Now, remember,
we use s for displacement.

136
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,179
We don't want to
use d because when

137
00:06:23,179 --> 00:06:24,970
you start doing calculus,
especially vector

138
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,680
calculus-- well, any
type of calculus--

139
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,275
you use d for the
derivative operator.

140
00:06:28,275 --> 00:06:30,900
If you don't know what that is,
don't worry about it right now.

141
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,695
But this right here,
s is displacement.

142
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,620
At least this is convention.

143
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,020
You could kind of use
anything, but this

144
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,020
is what most people use.

145
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,980
So if you don't want
to get confused,

146
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,146
or if you don't want to be
confused when they use s,

147
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:44,290
it's good to practice with it.

148
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,510
So it's the
displacement per time.

149
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,690
So it's displacement
divided by time.

150
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,920
Sometimes, once again,
you'll have displacement

151
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,910
per change in time,
which is really

152
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,342
a little bit more correct.

153
00:06:54,342 --> 00:06:56,050
But I'll just go with
the time right here

154
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,690
because this is the convention
that you see, at least in most

155
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,590
beginning physics books.

156
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,580
So once again, if we
want to solve for time,

157
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,100
you can multiply
both sides by time.

158
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,904
And you get-- this cancels
out-- and I'll flip this around.

159
00:07:09,904 --> 00:07:11,570
Well, actually, I'll
leave it like this.

160
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:17,050
So you get displacement
is equal to-- I

161
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,579
can flip these around--
velocity times change in time,

162
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:23,120
I should say.

163
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,328
Or we could just say time
just to keep things simple.

164
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:26,820
And if you want
to solve for time,

165
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,375
you divide both
sides by velocity.

166
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,750
And then that gives you time
is equal to displacement

167
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,629
divided by velocity.

168
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:39,670
And so we can apply that
to this right over here.

169
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,070
Our displacement is
720 meters to the east.

170
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,990
So in this case, our time
is equal to 720 meters

171
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,190
to the east.

172
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,980
720 meters east is
our displacement,

173
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,140
and we want to divide that
by the given velocity.

174
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,310
Well, they give us the
velocity of 3 meters

175
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,610
per second per the east.

176
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:12,470
And once again, 720 divided
by 3 will give you 240.

177
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,885
And then when you take
meters in the numerator,

178
00:08:15,885 --> 00:08:17,343
and you divide by
meters per second

179
00:08:17,343 --> 00:08:19,676
in the denominator, that's
the same thing as multiplying

180
00:08:19,676 --> 00:08:21,790
by seconds per meter,
those cancel out.

181
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,440
And you are just left
with seconds here.

182
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,860
One note I want to give you.

183
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,650
In the last few problems, I've
been making vector quantities

184
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,993
by saying to the
east, or going north.

185
00:08:30,993 --> 00:08:32,409
And what you're
going to see as we

186
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,130
go into more complex problems--
and this is what you might see

187
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,730
in typical physics
classes, or typical books,

188
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,440
is that you define a convention.

189
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,570
That maybe you'll say, the
positive direction, especially

190
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,660
when we're just dealing
with one dimension,

191
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,500
whether you can either
go forward or backwards,

192
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,684
or left or right.

193
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:51,350
We'll talk about other
vector quantities

194
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,280
when we can move in two
or three dimensions.

195
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,210
But they might take
some convention,

196
00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:00,780
like positive means maybe
you're moving to the east,

197
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,890
and maybe negative means
you're moving to the west.

198
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:09,220
And so that way-- well,
in the future, we'll see,

199
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,610
the math will
produce the results

200
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,960
that we see a little bit better.

201
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,140
So this would just be
a positive 720 meters.

202
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,787
This would be a positive
3 meters per second.

203
00:09:17,787 --> 00:09:19,870
And that implicitly tells
us that that's the east.

204
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,820
If it was negative, it
would then be to the west.

205
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,770
Something to think about.

206
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,978
We're going to start exploring
that a little bit more

207
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:26,220
in future videos.

208
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,889
And maybe we might say positive
is up, negative is down,

209
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:29,430
or who knows.

210
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,888
There's different
ways to define it

211
00:09:30,888 --> 00:09:34,590
when you're dealing
in one dimension.
