1
00:00:00,527 --> 00:00:02,860
Now that we know a little bit
about vectors and scalars,

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,365
let's try to apply what we
know about them for some pretty

3
00:00:06,365 --> 00:00:08,490
common problems you'd, one,
see in a physics class,

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,720
but they're also common problems
you'd see in everyday life,

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,900
because you're trying to
figure out how far you've gone,

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,660
or how fast you're
going, or how long it

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,190
might take you to
get some place.

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,320
So first I have, if
Shantanu was able to travel

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,540
5 kilometers north in
1 hour in his car, what

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,207
was his average velocity?

11
00:00:28,207 --> 00:00:29,790
So one, let's just
review a little bit

12
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,240
about what we know about
vectors and scalars.

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,350
So they're giving us that
he was able to travel

14
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,860
5 kilometers to the north.

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,250
So they gave us a magnitude,
that's the 5 kilometers.

16
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,530
That's the size of
how far he moved.

17
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,340
And they also give a direction.

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,410
So he moved a distance
of 5 kilometers.

19
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:51,980
Distance is the scalar.

20
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,710
But if you give the direction
too, you get the displacement.

21
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,390
So this right here
is a vector quantity.

22
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,100
He was displaced 5
kilometers to the north.

23
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,350
And he did it in
1 hour in his car.

24
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,050
What was his average velocity?

25
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,430
So velocity, and
there's many ways

26
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,060
that you might see it defined,
but velocity, once again,

27
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,690
is a vector quantity.

28
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,230
And the way that we
differentiate between vector

29
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,310
and scalar quantities
is we put little arrows

30
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,080
on top of vector quantities.

31
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,557
Normally they are bolded,
if you can have a typeface,

32
00:01:21,557 --> 00:01:23,140
and they have an
arrow on top of them.

33
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,681
But this tells you
that not only do I

34
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:26,760
care about the
value of this thing,

35
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,560
or I care about the
size of this thing,

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,014
I also care about its direction.

37
00:01:30,014 --> 00:01:30,930
That's what the arrow.

38
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,680
The arrow isn't
necessarily its direction,

39
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,870
it just tells you that
it is a vector quantity.

40
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:41,670
So the velocity of something
is its change in position,

41
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,440
including the direction
of its change in position.

42
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,220
So you could say
its displacement,

43
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,910
and the letter for
displacement is

44
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,050
S. And that is a
vector quantity,

45
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,850
so that is displacement.

46
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,040
And you might be
wondering, why don't they

47
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,850
use D for displacement?

48
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,050
That seems like a much
more natural first letter.

49
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,980
And my best sense of that is,
once you start doing calculus,

50
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,039
you start using D for
something very different.

51
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,680
You use it for the
derivative operator,

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,140
and that's so that the
D's don't get confused.

53
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,460
And that's why we use
S for displacement.

54
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,810
If someone has a better
explanation of that,

55
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,920
feel free to comment
on this video,

56
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,330
and then I'll add another
video explaining that better

57
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,670
explanation.

58
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,375
So velocity is your
displacement over time.

59
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,040
If I wanted to write an
analogous thing for the scalar

60
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,650
quantities, I could
write that speed,

61
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,250
and I'll write
out the word so we

62
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,150
don't get confused
with displacement.

63
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,730
Or maybe I'll write "rate."

64
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,202
Rate is another way that
sometimes people write speed.

65
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:50,660
So this is the vector version,
if you care about direction.

66
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,170
If you don't care
about direction,

67
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,240
you would have your rate.

68
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,730
So this is rate, or speed,
is equal to the distance

69
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:06,370
that you travel over some time.

70
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,910
So these two, you could
call them formulas, or you

71
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,560
could call them
definitions, although I

72
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,850
would think that they're
pretty intuitive for you.

73
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,830
How fast something is
going, you say, how far

74
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,937
did it go over some
period of time.

75
00:03:16,937 --> 00:03:18,770
These are essentially
saying the same thing.

76
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,552
This is when you
care about direction,

77
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:22,260
so you're dealing with
vector quantities.

78
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,342
This is where you're not so
conscientious about direction.

79
00:03:25,342 --> 00:03:27,050
And so you use distance,
which is scalar,

80
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,940
and you use rate or
speed, which is scalar.

81
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,834
Here you use displacement,
and you use velocity.

82
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:33,750
Now with that out of the
way, let's figure out

83
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,080
what his average velocity was.

84
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,040
And this key word,
average, is interesting.

85
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,670
Because it's possible that
his velocity was changing

86
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,500
over that whole time period.

87
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,147
But for the sake of
simplicity, we're

88
00:03:45,147 --> 00:03:47,480
going to assume that it was
kind of a constant velocity.

89
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,470
What we are calculating is going
to be his average velocity.

90
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,053
But don't worry about
it, you can just

91
00:03:52,053 --> 00:03:54,930
assume that it wasn't changing
over that time period.

92
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,250
So his velocity is,
his displacement

93
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:08,590
was 5 kilometers to the north--
I'll write just a big capital.

94
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,680
Well, let me just write it
out, 5 kilometers north--

95
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,699
over the amount of
time it took him.

96
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:17,740
And let me make it clear.

97
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,870
This is change in time.

98
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,250
This is also a change in time.

99
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,290
Sometimes you'll just
see a t written there.

100
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,660
Sometimes you'll see
someone actually put

101
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,360
this little triangle,
the character delta,

102
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,200
in front of it, which
explicitly means "change in."

103
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,030
It looks like a very fancy
mathematics when you see that,

104
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,750
but a triangle in
front of something

105
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,170
literally means "change in."

106
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,950
So this is change in time.

107
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,240
So he goes 5 kilometers
north, and it took him 1 hour.

108
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,130
So the change in
time was 1 hour.

109
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,250
So let me write that over here.

110
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,080
So over 1 hour.

111
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,050
So this is equal
to, if you just look

112
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,290
at the numerical
part of it, it is

113
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:07,910
5/1-- let me just write
it out, 5/1-- kilometers,

114
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,820
and you can treat the
units the same way

115
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,700
you would treat the
quantities in a fraction.

116
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:22,390
5/1 kilometers per hour,
and then to the north.

117
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,530
Or you could say this
is the same thing

118
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,456
as 5 kilometers per hour north.

119
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:39,590
So this is 5 kilometers
per hour to the north.

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,164
So that's his average velocity,
5 kilometers per hour.

121
00:05:47,164 --> 00:05:49,580
And you have to be careful,
you have to say "to the north"

122
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,766
if you want velocity.

123
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,640
If someone just said "5
kilometers per hour,"

124
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,270
they're giving you a speed,
or rate, or a scalar quantity.

125
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,839
You have to give the direction
for it to be a vector quantity.

126
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,880
You could do the same
thing if someone just said,

127
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,180
what was his average
speed over that time?

128
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,350
You could have said, well, his
average speed, or his rate,

129
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,520
would be the
distance he travels.

130
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,310
The distance, we don't care
about the direction now,

131
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,270
is 5 kilometers, and
he does it in 1 hour.

132
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,180
His change in time is 1 hour.

133
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:28,120
So this is the same thing
as 5 kilometers per hour.

134
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,110
So once again, we're only
giving the magnitude here.

135
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,720
This is a scalar quantity.

136
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,100
If you want the vector, you
have to do the north as well.

137
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,830
Now, you might be saying,
hey, in the previous video,

138
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,370
we talked about things in
terms of meters per second.

139
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,220
Here, I give you kilometers,
or "kil-om-eters,"

140
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,980
depending on how you
want to pronounce it,

141
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,462
kilometers per hour.

142
00:06:47,462 --> 00:06:49,420
What if someone wanted
it in meters per second,

143
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,120
or what if I just wanted to
understand how many meters he

144
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,690
travels in a second?

145
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,260
And there, it just becomes
a unit conversion problem.

146
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,320
And I figure it doesn't hurt
to work on that right now.

147
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,360
So if we wanted to do
this to meters per second,

148
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,850
how would we do it?

149
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,590
Well, the first step is to
think about how many meters we

150
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,330
are traveling in an hour.

151
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,900
So let's take that 5
kilometers per hour,

152
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,490
and we want to
convert it to meters.

153
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,880
So I put meters
in the numerator,

154
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,680
and I put kilometers
in the denominator.

155
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,500
And the reason why I do that
is because the kilometers

156
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,333
are going to cancel out
with the kilometers.

157
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,020
And how many meters are
there per kilometer?

158
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,915
Well, there's 1,000 meters
for every 1 kilometer.

159
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,990
And I set this up right here so
that the kilometers cancel out.

160
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,870
So these two
characters cancel out.

161
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:47,200
And if you multiply,
you get 5,000.

162
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,460
So you have 5 times 1,000.

163
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,340
So let me write this-- I'll do
it in the same color-- 5 times

164
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,205
1,000.

165
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:56,580
So I just multiplied
the numbers.

166
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,340
When you multiply something,
you can switch around the order.

167
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,200
Multiplication is
commutative-- I always

168
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,470
have trouble pronouncing
that-- and associative.

169
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,930
And then in the units, in the
numerator, you have meters,

170
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,800
and in the denominator,
you have hours.

171
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,680
Meters per hour.

172
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:23,010
And so this is equal to
5,000 meters per hour.

173
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,300
And you might say,
hey, Sal, I know

174
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,220
that 5 kilometers is the
same thing as 5,000 meters.

175
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,880
I could do that in my head.

176
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,320
And you probably could.

177
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,780
But this canceling out
dimensions, or what's

178
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,770
often called
dimensional analysis,

179
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,030
can get useful once you
start doing really, really

180
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,039
complicated things with less
intuitive units than something

181
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,720
like this.

182
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,960
But you should always do an
intuitive gut check right here.

183
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,180
You know that if you do
5 kilometers in an hour,

184
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,800
that's a ton of meters.

185
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,830
So you should get
a larger number

186
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,910
if you're talking
about meters per hour.

187
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,770
And now when we want
to go to seconds,

188
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,530
let's do an intuitive gut check.

189
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,540
If something is traveling a
certain amount in an hour,

190
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,390
it should travel a much
smaller amount in a second,

191
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,450
or 1/3,600 of an hour, because
that's how many seconds there

192
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,469
are in an hour.

193
00:09:08,469 --> 00:09:09,510
So that's your gut check.

194
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,176
We should get a smaller
number than this

195
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,130
when we want to say
meters per second.

196
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,020
But let's actually do it with
the dimensional analysis.

197
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,830
So we want to cancel
out the hours,

198
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,460
and we want to be left with
seconds in the denominator.

199
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,790
So the best way to cancel
this hours in the denominator

200
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:27,640
is by having hours
in the numerator.

201
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,810
So you have hours per second.

202
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,380
So how many hours
are there per second?

203
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,260
Or another way to
think about it, 1 hour,

204
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,670
think about the larger unit,
1 hour is how many seconds?

205
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:47,100
Well, you have 60 seconds
per minute times 60 minutes

206
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,730
per hour.

207
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,090
The minutes cancel out.

208
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:00,510
60 times 60 is 3,600
seconds per hour.

209
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,310
So you could say this is 3,600
seconds for every 1 hour,

210
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:16,307
or if you flip them, you would
get 1/3,600 hour per second,

211
00:10:16,307 --> 00:10:18,640
or hours per second, depending
on how you want to do it.

212
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:25,130
So 1 hour is the same
thing as 3,600 seconds.

213
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,000
And so now this hour
cancels out with that hour,

214
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,870
and then you multiply,
or appropriately divide,

215
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,390
the numbers right here.

216
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:43,800
And you get this is equal
to 5,000 over 3,600 meters

217
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,380
per-- all you have left in the
denominator here is second.

218
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,590
Meters per second.

219
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,930
And if we divide both the
numerator and the denominator--

220
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,220
I could do this by hand, but
just because this video's

221
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,750
already getting a
little bit long,

222
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,990
let me get my trusty
calculator out.

223
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:05,470
I get my trusty calculator
out just for the sake of time.

224
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,280
5,000 divided by 3,600, which
would be really the same thing

225
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,410
as 50 divided by
36, that is 1.3--

226
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,300
I'll just round it
over here-- 1.39.

227
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:33,440
So this is equal to
1.39 meters per second.

228
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,459
So Shantanu was traveling
quite slow in his car.

229
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,250
Well, we knew that just
by looking at this.

230
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,570
5 kilometers per hour, that's
pretty much just letting

231
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:44,480
the car roll pretty slowly.
