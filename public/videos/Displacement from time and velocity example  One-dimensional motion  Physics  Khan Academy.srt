1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,180
Let's do one more
example dealing

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,120
with displacement,
velocity, and time.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,220
So we have if Marcia travels for
1 minute at 5 meters per second

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,490
to the south, how much
will she be displaced?

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,170
Let me do it this way.

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:29,270
We know that velocity
is equal to displacement

7
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,030
divided by time.

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,490
And it's really, once
again, it is change in time.

9
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,860
But we'll just say time.

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,714
That's implicitly
change in time.

11
00:00:36,714 --> 00:00:38,380
And if you manipulate
this a little bit,

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,390
you really just multiply
both sides by time.

13
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,980
You just multiply both
sides by the variable t.

14
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,309
You get displacement.

15
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:47,350
Because this cancels out.

16
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,100
You get displacement.

17
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,420
And I'll flip this around.

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,780
What's on the right-hand
side, I'll write on the left.

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,730
So you get displacement
is equal to time

20
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,120
times velocity or
velocity times time.

21
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,970
Is equal to velocity times
time or velocity times

22
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,450
change in time.

23
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,000
So over here, they're
asking us for displacement.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,500
They're asking us how much
did Marcia get displaced?

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,390
And they're saying that
she travels for 1 minute.

26
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,894
So this 1 minute right over
here, this is her time.

27
00:01:18,894 --> 00:01:21,060
Sometimes you could view
that as her change in time.

28
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,660
Or it really is
her change in time.

29
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,150
If it said 0 minutes on her
stopwatch when she started,

30
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,400
at the end it'll say 1 minute.

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,170
Or if it said 5
minutes, if maybe it

32
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,330
was 3:05 when she
started, it would be 3:06

33
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,080
when she finished.

34
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,712
So it was really
the change in time.

35
00:01:34,712 --> 00:01:36,420
Once again, I won't
write the delta there

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,446
just because this is the way
you most frequently see it.

37
00:01:40,446 --> 00:01:41,820
But I want to tell
you that these

38
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,560
are the same thing for the
purpose of this problem

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,790
because sometimes you'll
see the delta there.

40
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,940
So the 1 minute, so the t
right over here is 1 minute.

41
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,030
At 5 meters per
second to the south.

42
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,450
This right over here
is the velocity.

43
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,820
They give us the magnitude,
which is 5 meters per second.

44
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,330
Or you could say
that's the speed.

45
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,610
And they also give us the
direction, to the south.

46
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:19,860
So this right over here is 5
meters per second to the south.

47
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,810
So we might just say, look, if
we want displacement, that's

48
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:33,190
just going to be equal to 5
meters per second to the south

49
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,630
times 1 minute.

50
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,915
The problem here
is that when we're

51
00:02:41,915 --> 00:02:43,290
talking about
displacement, we're

52
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,180
going to think about a magnitude
of how much it's moved.

53
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,360
So it'll be a
distance of some kind.

54
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,220
And some direction.

55
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,890
We have our direction
here, but we

56
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,786
don't want any
other units there.

57
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:54,410
And if we just multiply
this over here,

58
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,966
we have 1 minute over here.

59
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:57,590
But we have seconds
in the denominator.

60
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,360
You can't just cancel out
a minute and a second.

61
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,000
So you can't just
say that you're

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,430
going to get 5 and have
some weird thing here.

63
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,900
So in order for it
to all work out,

64
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,310
you have to either convert
the 5 meters per second to 5

65
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,590
meters per minute.

66
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,580
Or let me phrase
that another way.

67
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,470
You have to convert
the 5 meters per second

68
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,520
to some amount of
meters per minute,

69
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,530
not 5 meters per minute.

70
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,654
It's going to be different.

71
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,560
Or you convert the
1 minute to seconds.

72
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,260
So at least in my
mind, it's easier

73
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,450
to convert 1 minute to seconds.

74
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,120
So let's do that.

75
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,230
So this is the same thing.

76
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,679
1 minute times.

77
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:30,220
And we want to get
rid of the minute.

78
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,350
And the minute is essentially
in the numerator right now.

79
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,470
We could put this over 1.

80
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,550
But it's essentially
in the numerator.

81
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,883
So we want to divide by minutes.

82
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,790
And we want to
multiply by seconds.

83
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,290
We want seconds
in the numerator.

84
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,210
And so how many seconds
are there per minute?

85
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,602
You have 60 seconds
for every 1 minute.

86
00:03:50,602 --> 00:03:52,435
And so you have a minute
cancelling out with

87
00:03:52,435 --> 00:03:53,380
the minutes.

88
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,060
And so now you have
5 meters per second

89
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,950
to the south times 60 seconds.

90
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,170
This is now cool because you
have seconds and seconds.

91
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,020
I wrote "sec" there,
but this is also sec.

92
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,520
So now you have
seconds over seconds.

93
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,850
Those cancel out.

94
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,730
And so your
displacement is going

95
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,820
to be equal to 5 times 60.

96
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,779
And then your units
left are meters.

97
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,210
All the time units have
cancelled out and then

98
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,410
it's meters to the south.

99
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:30,870
So meters to the south.

100
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:41,100
And this is equal to 5 times
60 is 300 meters to the south.

101
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,690
And we are done.

102
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,840
That's how much she
has been displaced.

103
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,470
If they just wanted
the distance,

104
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,380
you could say that she
traveled 300 meters.

105
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,110
Just that part.

106
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,250
The magnitude of
the displacement,

107
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,700
that is the distance
that she traveled.
